# Random-Personal-Projects
This is a public repository of random stuff I create. 99% of this stuff will be useless! This also means that pretty much none of these projects will have commented code or good-looking, optimized code.

<h1> Current projects in this repository</h1>
<ul>
  <li><b>Snake game in Processing 3</b></li>
  <li><b>I'll add more as I create them...</b></li>
</ul>

<h2>If you're interested in my future projects, feel free to add this repository to your <emph>Watch List</emph>.</h2>
<p>All of the code here will be completely free for your use (Although I wouldn't mind some credit).</p> 

<h3>There's nothing else here!</h3>
